            <p>This is the story of a pumpkin named Punk. Unlike most pumpkins, this pumkin was fuschia and glistened in the sun. When Punk was just a lonely seedling lying in the soil, a unicorn happened by, searching for a snack. A snake startled the unicorn, causing it to sneeze magical unicorn dust, which was carried to the location Punk was located. This unicorn inadvertently caused Punk to become an extra special pumpkin.</p>
            <p>On beautiful day in early October, Punk became a full-grown pumpkin - two sparkling purple arms and two legs popped out of her sides! She began to roll down the hill but was able to gain control with her newly formed arms and legs. Punk got up and exclaimed,"HUMPH! This is quite unusual!"</p>
            <p>"You can say that again!" shouted a litte girl that was playing nearby on the hill. "Are you an alien?"</p>
            <p>"An alien? No, I'm a pumpkin, of course. My name is Punk."</p>
            <p>"Well, good, It's nice to meet you, Punk. I'm not allowed to tell me name to strangers and you are quite strange." said the sassy 8 year-old.</p>
            <p>"Would you mind helping me? I'm not used to these things that popped out of me. They seem rather useful but also clumsy."</p>
            <p>The little girl laughed. She relunctantly helped punk stand and walk. Little did she know at the time but this event changed her life; they became great friends.</p>
